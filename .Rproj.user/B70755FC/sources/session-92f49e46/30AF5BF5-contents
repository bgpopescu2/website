# Step to Create a Website

* We now need to add a .nojekyll file to the root of our repository

* This tells GitHub Pages not to do additional processing of your published site using Jekyll


**Mac**\
```{bash}
touch .nojekyll
```


**Windows**\
```{bash}
copy NUL .nojekyll
```


# Step to Create a Website

You should now see your website in on of your computer

This will be the (friendly) means of communication between GitHub and your computer

This means that you first make those changes on your computer

You will then upload those changes to GitHub, which hosts your website


# Download GitHub Desktop

Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com){target="_blank"} and install it on your machine
